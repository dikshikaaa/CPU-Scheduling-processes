# CPU-Scheduling-processes

CPU scheduling is the process of selecting the next process to be executed on the CPU in a computer system. Since there are typically many processes competing for the CPU's attention at any given time, CPU scheduling plays an important role in ensuring that each process gets a fair share of the CPU's processing time. There are several types of CPU scheduling algorithms, which vary in their complexity and performance characteristics.

Here are some of the most common types of CPU scheduling algorithms
 1.First Come First Serve
 2.Shortest Job First
 3.Priority Non - preemtive
 4.Shortest Remaining Time first
 5.Priority Preemtive
 
This repo is a collection of these alogorithms written in C language
