Round Robin (RR) scheduling is a CPU scheduling algorithm that allocates a fixed time slice, or quantum, to each process in a circular queue. When a process is given the CPU, it is allowed to run for the quantum. If it completes within the quantum, it is removed from the queue. If it is not finished, it is moved to the end of the queue, and the next process is selected to run.

Here is a high-level overview of how the Round Robin scheduling algorithm works:

When a process arrives, it is added to the end of a circular queue.
The CPU is assigned to the first process in the queue for a fixed time slice (the quantum).
If the process completes within the quantum, it is removed from the queue.
If the process does not complete within the quantum, it is moved to the end of the queue and the next process is selected.
The queue is traversed in a circular manner, with the first process becoming the last after all other processes have had a turn.
When all processes have had a turn, the cycle is repeated.
Round Robin scheduling can be implemented using a variety of data structures, such as a circular queue or a linked list. The algorithm is simple and fair, and ensures that no single process monopolizes the CPU for an extended period of time.
